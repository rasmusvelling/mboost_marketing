Together with two colleagues, I created a blog post for the KAYAK Tech blog at Medium. This repo contains the underlying .Rmd file used to generate the examples.

The original blog post can be found at : https://medium.com/kayak-tech/using-ai-to-optimize-marketing-across-multiple-platforms-6602e3765b2f

I have posted it to my github page at : https://rasmusvelling.github.io/blog/2018/09/26/using-ai-to-optimize-marketing
